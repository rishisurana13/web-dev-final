He joined FC Barcelona's youth academy when he was just 13 years old, and quickly rose through the ranks to become a star player for the club. Over the course of his career, Messi has won numerous awards and accolades, including the Ballon d'Or (an award given to the best soccer player in the world) a record seven times. He has helped lead FC Barcelona to countless victories, and has also been a key player for the Argentine national team. Messi's incredible skill, speed, and agility on the field have made him a beloved figure in the soccer world and a true icon of the sport.</p>

        Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga At√≥mica ("The Atomic Flea"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it." Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.
