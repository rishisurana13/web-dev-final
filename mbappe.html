Born on December 20, 1998, in Bondy, France, Mbappe began his footballing career at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the top players in the world. He made his professional debut for AS Monaco in 2015 at the age of just 16, and soon became a regular starter for the club.

      Mbappé has been described by Arsène Wenger as a "huge football talent" who "has similarities to Thierry Henry".His talent and precocious performances for France at the 2018 World Cup also led him to be compared to Pelé in the media.A versatile forward, Mbappé often plays as a winger, and is capable of playing on either flank, due to his ability with both feet. He is capable of cutting into the centre onto his stronger right foot from the left wing, and is also capable of creating chances and providing assists for teammates from the right due to his vision. He is also able to play in the centre as a main striker, due to his composure, clinical finishing, and eye for goal. A highly skilful player, Mbappé is also known for his excellent dribbling ability, as well as his explosive acceleration, agility, quick feet, and creativity when in possession of the ball, as demonstrated by his use of elaborate feints, such as step overs, or sudden changes of pace or direction to beat opponents in one on one situations. At age 17, he had a lean frame but was gifted with physical strength and athleticism.By age 22, he had physically developed into an elite goalscorer.
