    Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese professional footballer widely considered as one of the greatest players of all time. He was born on February 5, 1985, on the island of Madeira, Portugal. Ronaldo began his football career at the age of eight, joining Andorinha, before moving to Nacional. Later, he signed with Sporting CP, where he caught the attention of Manchester United, leading to his transfer to the English club in 2003. After six successful seasons at United, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a then-world-record transfer fee in 2009. In 2018, he signed with Juventus, where he currently plays.

        A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.
