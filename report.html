			<h2>Accessibility</h2>
			<ol>
	<li>The website is designed to be responsive and can be accessed on different devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.  The use of the meta viewport tag and responsive design techniques such as using relative units for font sizes and media queries to adjust layout for different screen sizes makes the site accessible on a wide range of devices.</li>
	<li>The website's navigation menu is easy to use and clearly identifies the different pages, making it easy for users to find the content they are looking for. </li>
	<li>The website follows accessibility standards, such as using descriptive alt text for images and ensuring that the site is navigable using keyboard-only commands for users who may have disabilities that prevent them from using a mouse. The use of semantic HTML tags such as nav, header, main and section makes the site more accessible to users who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
                <li>The use of the "title" attribute in the navigation links provides additional information about the content of the linked pages to users who may have difficulty interpreting the context of the link based solely on its text.</li>
</ol>

			<h2>Learning</h2>
			<ol>
            <li>I had to learn what truly makes a site accessible and what semantic elements I would need. </li>
            
            <li> As a user of React, it took some work be able to code in inline, vanilla JavaScript</li>
                <li>I had to learn about breakpoints to make the website usable across devices</li>
                </ol>

			<h2>Evaluation I</h2>
			<p>I believe the website's usability is an area of success. Though simple, the website is intuitive enough for a user to understand what they may get from the site. <br> Another thing that works, in my opinon, is the simple design behind the website, with tons of whitespace so the design can breathe while allowing a user to read without straining their eyes.
            <br>
                I am also pleased with the responsiveness of the site as well as the accessibility practices implemented.
                
                <br>
                I also implemented filtering on a table, with some additional functionality of checking if a list is sorted and reversing the list if so to enable the toggling of the rows easily. 
            </p>

			<h2>Evaluation II</h2>
			<p> I am not quite happy about the JavaScript, I believe I could've organized the code better by having the Table method as a class. 
            <br>
                I also feel like the website could've been a little more comprehensive. Right now, 5 footballers feels too less in a world where there are so many top players. 
                
                <br>
                The site could also do with some more media as well.
